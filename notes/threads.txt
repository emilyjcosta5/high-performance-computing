pthreads API
4 groups
1. Thread management- create, detach, join, etc.
2. mutexes- create, destroy, lock, unlock
3. conditional variables- communication between threads
4. synchronization- read/wrtie lock and barriers

Semaphore
2 states: open or closed
2 operations:
	1. wait (semaphore)- block until semaphore is open then decrements it, P()
	2. signal (semaphore)- increments to allow another thread to enter, V()
conditional variables (CVs)- sync between multiple threads, sync based on the data value
pthread-cond-int- int the conditional variable
wait- blocks on the CV
etc...
