parallel languages
------------------
1. high-performance Fortran (HPF)
	- extends Fortran 90
	- adds pragmas to Fortran 90
	- FORALL: loop iterations are independent
	- PURE: only working on locally defined data

2. partitioned global address space (PGAS)
	- a single shared memory address space is partitioned where each partition has an affinity with a thread or process

3. Chapel
	- allows programmer to specify the placement of data and tasks
	- focus on portability
	- developed by Cray

4. Linda
	- developed by Bell Labs
	- manages data in tuples

5. Unified Parallel C
	- single, partitioned address space, uses an SPMD
	- fixes computation-to-core mapping at compile time

6. Cilk
	- provide express parallel loos and fork-join operations
	- developed in MIT
